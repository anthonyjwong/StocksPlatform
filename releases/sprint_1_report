Sprint 1 Report

Product Name: BananaStocks
Team Name: Stocks Team
Date: April 19th, 2020

Actions to stop doing
We want to stop having a lack of communication. This is the only real problem we had near the beginning of this sprint. Most of us are adjusting to working on a complex project like this, sometimes members are nervous to share their confusion. Our communication has improved as we have adjusted and become more confident in our product.

Actions to start doing
We want to start rotating taking notes during each of our team meetings so that we have a better record of what each team member is doing and we can better remember what we have discussed.

Actions to keep doing
We want to keep meeting for 15 minutes for 3x/week because it helps us keep in constant communication as well as allowing us to stay updated on each otherâ€™s progress.

We want to keep trying to initiate a pull request once a week per each team member so that we are always making incremental progress that can be clearly seen and checked up on.
