When a user logs in through google oauth, then logs out, we need to delete that provider?
When a user with oauth logs in, their access token expires, need to update in table?

For deleting an account, it requires a valid Access Token, maybe change this to also include refresh token?


Change oauth username to email.
username is no longer unique

//Creating more unit tests
//Been working on functionality for users to delete their account
//resetting or replacing their username because if they signed in through the oauth, they have a
//string of digits as their username.
//Looking into implementing email verification for accounts and also a forgot password feature

//  but these would be implemented later on
